**<h1>How to process :</h1>**

**Load and Understand the Data**

Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and inspect its structure.
Identify the columns and their data types, look for missing values, and understand the data.

**Data Preprocessing**

Handle missing values and outliers.
Encode categorical variables into numerical format.
Normalize or scale numerical features if necessary.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Visualize distributions, correlations, and imbalances in the data.
Investigate relationships between features and the target variable (customer churn).

**Feature Selection**

Select the most impactful features using correlation matrices, statistical tests, or feature importance scores.

**Model Building**

Train multiple machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and k-NN.
Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.

**Model Evaluation**

Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC to evaluate the models.

**Model Tuning and Refinement**

Optimize hyperparameters of the selected models to improve their performance.

**Expandability and Business Perspective**

Interpret the model's output and explain the importance of features from a business standpoint.
